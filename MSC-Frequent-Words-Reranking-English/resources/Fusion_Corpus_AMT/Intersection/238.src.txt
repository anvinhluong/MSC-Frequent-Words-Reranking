The California section of the report, for example, points to a passage of a law requiring the order of layoff to reflect affirmative action programs and not merely seniority (contrast our position in the Boston layoff case) and a staggeringly pernicious law codifying the anti-capitalist notion of 'comparable worth' (as opposed to market value) pay scales."
Roberts listed a California law that required layoffs "to reflect affirmative action programs and not merely seniority"; another state law he said was "staggeringly pernicious" that codified "the anti-capitalist notion of 'comparable worth' (as opposed to market value) pay scales"; and a "presumably unconstitutional" proposal to charge women less tuition at Florida schools because they have "less earning potential."
