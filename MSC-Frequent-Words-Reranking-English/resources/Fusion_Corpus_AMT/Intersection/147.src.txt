Indeed, Robert Bork was rightly overwhelmingly rejected by the Senate in 1987 in large part because he did not believe in constitutional protection for privacy rights, which include the right to marry, the right to procreate, the right to custody and upbringing of one's children, the right to purchase and use contraceptives, and the right to abortion.
Based on this, the Court has safeguarded the right to marry, the right to procreate, the right to custody of one's children, the right to keep the family together, the right to control the upbringing of one's children, the right to purchase and use contraceptives, the right to refuse medical care, and the right to engage in private consensual homosexual activity.
