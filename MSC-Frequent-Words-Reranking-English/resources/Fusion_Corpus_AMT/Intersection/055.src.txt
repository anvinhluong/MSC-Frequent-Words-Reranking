Bush on Tuesday announced the nomination of Roberts, 50, a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a frequent swing vote on the high court who is retiring.
Roberts, nominated to succeed retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, easily won Senate confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit two years ago.
