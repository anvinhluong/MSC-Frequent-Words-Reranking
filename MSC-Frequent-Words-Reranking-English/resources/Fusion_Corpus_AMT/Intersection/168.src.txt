Roberts listed a California law that required layoffs "to reflect affirmative action programs and not merely seniority"; another state law he said was "staggeringly pernicious" that codified "the anti-capitalist notion of 'comparable worth' (as opposed to market value) pay scales"; and a "presumably unconstitutional" proposal to charge women less tuition at Florida schools because they have "less earning potential."
In several 1983 memos, Mr. Roberts derided passage of a California law that required the order of layoffs to reflect affirmative action considerations and condemned another "staggeringly pernicious law codifying the anti-capitalist notion of 'comparable worth' (as opposed to market value) pay scales."
