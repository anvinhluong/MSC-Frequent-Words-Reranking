The White House yesterday began releasing the first of 75,000 pages of documents stemming from Roberts's service as a lawyer in President Ronald Reagan's administration two decades ago but refused to release papers from his time as deputy solicitor general under President George H.W. Bush from 1989 to 1993.
The White House riled Senate Democrats on Tuesday when it began releasing the first of up to 75,000 pages of documents from his work in the Reagan administration, but said it would refuse to release papers from his time as deputy solicitor general in the first Bush administration.
